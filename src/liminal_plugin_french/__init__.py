"""Kenneth R. French Data Library (Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth) for Liminal: the Fama/French
factors and the 49 industry portfolios, daily and monthly from 1926 (1963 for the 5 factors), returns
in percent. Datasets only (Publisher.datasets): each a zipped CSV from the library's own server,
fetched with the app's `datasets fetch` and again every 30 days. The library updates its files about
two months after a month ends, so a first import's values are dated the 15th of the second month
after theirs.

A Liminal plugin released on its own (liminal.sources.publisher: Publisher), registered under the
entry point group `liminal.providers` as `french`. It relies on plugin API 1.4 (datasets declared by
a publisher) and nothing of the app outside it (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md in liminal: "Providers are
plugins"); its version is this distribution's (pyproject.toml), so PUBLISHER.version is left empty.
